<h4 class="stopify-heading">What is Stopify?</h4>

<p class="p1">
Scores of languages now compile to JavaScript, which allows programmers to use
many languages on the Web. Unfortunately, most compilers simply inherit
the browser's execution model: long-running programs freeze the browser tab,
blocking operations do not work, deeply recursive programs quickly overflow the
stack, infinite loops crash Web-based IDEs, and so on. Stopify is a
JavaScript-to-JavaScript compiler that is designed to help compiler authors
address these limitations easily and efficiently.

<h4 class="stopify-heading">How does Stopify work?</h4>
<p class="p1">
There are four key pieces to Stopify.

<ul>

<li><b>First-class continuations:</b> Stopify's abstractions rely on
first-class continuations, which it provides by compiling JavaScript to
JavaScript.</li>

<li><b>Browser-specific optimizations:</b>
There are several ways to implement continuations in JavaScript and it
turns out that different approaches work best on different browsers.
Stopify can give a compiler multiple backends to maximize performance.
</li>

<li><b>Sub-languages of JavaScript:</b> JavaScript has several unusual language
features that make it very difficult to implement Stopify efficiently.
Fortunately, most source languages compile to sub-languages of JavaScript that
don't use all of JavaScript's features. (<i>e.g.,</i> the image of OCaml in
JavaScript is very simple sub-language of JavaScript.) We have identified
several sub-languages that many compilers use and Stopify exploits them to
maximize performance.</li>

<li><b>Time estimation:</b> Stopify needs to periodically interrupt execution
and yield control to the browser's event loop. The frequency of interruptions
has to strike a balance between performance and responsiveness. Moreover,
checking the system time too frequently from JavaScript also slows
the program down. Stopify uses a sampling-based technique to estimate
the rate at which the program executes and dynamically adjusts the interrupt
rate.</li>

</ul>

<h4 class="stopify-heading">How does Stopify perform?</h4>
<p class="p1">
See the question above: it depends on the source language and the sub-language
of JavaScript that the source language compiler uses. We have extensive
benchmarks that we can share if you're interested. But, to give an example, on
Python (using PyJS), we find that the median slowdown is 1.4x. PyJS doesn't use
all of JavaScript's features and we can exploit that to improve performance.
Our worst slowdown is when the source language is JavaScript itself because we
can't make simplifying assumptions. The median slowdown we get on the Kraken
benchmark squite is 20x. These are slowdowns on a $200 ChromeBook. We also have
results from the four major browsers on a desktop machine.

<h4 class="stopify-heading">Why not use Web Workers?</h4>
<p class="p1">
Stopify runs programs on the main JavaScript thread, which gives you full
access to the DOM, the network, etc. This is particularly important for many
web-based IDEs that rely on graphics. A Web Worker would give us to ability to
run a long-running computation and kill it, but would make DOM access much
harder. Moreover, a Web Worker does not provide provide the rich execution
control that Stopify provides, e.g., pausing, breakpointing, and deep stacks.

<h4 class="stopify-heading">Why not use WebAssembly?</h4>
<p class="p1">

We think WebAssembly is awesome! However, at the moment, it is really designed
to be a target for C/C++. Currently, garbage collection, threads, tail calls,
and host bindings (e.g., access to the DOM) are in the feature proposal stage.
Threfore, WebAssembly today does not provide enough features to prototype a
Stopify-like solution. As WebAssembly evolves to support higher-level
languages, web-based IDEs will want to use it. For that to happen, WebAssembly
will need to support the kind of execution control that Stopify provides for
JavaScript.

<h4 class="stopify-heading">Can Stopify be applied to more than IDEs?</h4>
<p class="p1">

Yes! Stopify implements first-class continuations for JavaScript, so you can
easily use it to build anything that first-class continuations allow. Let
us know what you do with Stopify!
